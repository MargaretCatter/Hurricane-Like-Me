# Hurricane-Like-Me

Highly functional disaster masquerading as a person.

Our story is about a highly functional disaster masquerading as a person. Eir Warren, a late twenty-something city girl seems to be put together, but that comes apart once the work clothes come off. While dedicated and good at her job, Eir is overworked and seemingly underappreciated, isolated from coworkers. Eirs bad goes from meh to miserable when she loses her bag on a train, carrying both her work materials and her confidence. At that point, if not for the bills she needed to pay, Eir would’ve quit everything and never left her apartment again. However, when a very kind Troy Colby finds her bag, he decides to make it his mission to return it to her as one good deed before his life starts to shift. These are the adventures of Troy’s attempt to return the bag and Eir’s growth as a person when she realizes she’s a category four in the hurricane that is her life.
